::: {#hero-heading}

My name is Shihang Liu, a current Master's student in cosmology at Guangxi University, supervised by [Bohua Li](https://prof.gxu.edu.cn/teacherDetails/5223c932-91c4-4a78-9926-9b9ff7708e8a). 

This is my personal academic homepage, where you can find my CV, research/study notes, publications, and other relevant information. The pages are still under construction as my academic journey progresses. Since I‚Äôm still in the early stages of my research, some content may be quite basic‚Äîany advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated! 

I am currently seeking PhD opportunities, and I hope both my academic career and this website will continue to evolve over time.
